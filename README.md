# ECMAScript (ITI)
- Part of ITI Intensive Training Bootcamp

## Goal
- To teach ECMAScript features that were introduced in the last few years.

## Structure
- Each Folder represents a day of the training.
- It has Task description (either in PDF or image).
- The solution (usually found in structured folders or same folder for Tasks that had single goal)


## Suggestions & Improvements
