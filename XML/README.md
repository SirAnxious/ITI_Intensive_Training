# XML (ITI)
- Part of ITI Intensive Training Bootcamp

## Goal
- To have better understanding of XML, it's schemas and how it works.
- Both DTD, it's shortcomings and how XSD (Schema) helps mitigate the problems.

## Structure
- Each Task, you are given an XML file.
- Day one you need to create Document Type Definition (DTD) for the XML file.
- Day two you need to create Schema (XSD) for the XML file

## Suggestions & Improvements
- If you think one of the solutions could be done better, please make an issue and I will take a look as soon as possible ^_^

## Requirements:
- XML Copy Editor
